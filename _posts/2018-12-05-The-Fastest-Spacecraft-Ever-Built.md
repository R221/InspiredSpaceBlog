## On a mission to better understand energy
*This is part one in a multi-part series.*  
*For more in-depth information, stay tuned for follow-up articles.*

[Dr. Eugene Parker](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/eugene-newman-parker) is an accomplished theoretical physict whose name you may not recognize. Heard of *solar wind*? Well, he's the guy who discovered it. And now his name christens the fastest ever manmade spacecraft: The **Parker Solar Probe (PSP)**.   

And it's heading right towards the Sun.  

Back in 1958, Dr. Parker published [Dynamics of the Interplanetary Gas and Magnetic Fields](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1958ApJ...128..664P&data_type=PDF_HIGH&whole_paper=YES&type=PRINTER&filetype=.pdf) outlining his theory that solar wind emanates from celestial bodies. At first, nobody believed him. *Why would there be stuff between us and the Sun? It's just empty, duh!*  

But just four years later, Mariner 2 proved Dr. Parker right by discovering the presence of this energy. Great! So now time to send a probe and examine it, right? Well, not quite yet.  
  
In fact, it just launched on August 12, 2018. Talk about delayed gratification.

### What the heck is solar wind and why is it so important?

[Solar wind](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml) is the energy given off by the Sun's upper atmosphere, the *corona*, that permeates the entire solar system.

It's important to study for several practical reasons: 
   
1. It is hugely impactful on Earth's immediate environment
2. To understand interplanetary travel conditions (as solar wind is everywhere)
3. To gain a better understanding of the Sun and thus gain insight in the behavior of other stars

But perhaps the most interesting reason of all:  
  
*Controlled nuclear fusion*. When two particles are pushed together until the merge, thus producing incredible amounts of energy. If we can perfect this process, Earth will have a much more efficent (and not to mention cheap) source of energy. We're not so far from it. The UK -- one day before this writing -- just announced ["Fusion Island", where they hope to demonstrate controlled fusion by 2019](https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3067747/fusion-island-uk-start-up-reveals-plans-for-pioneering-nuclear-fusion-research).  

What a time to be alive.  
  
### Now that that's out of the way...

The PSP measures quite a few variables using a group of sensors known as *SWEAP*.  
  
- **S**olar  
- **W**ind  
- **E**lectrons  
- **A**lpha (particles)  
- **P**rotons  
  
Most of these sensors are located on the backside of the probe, and therefore collect information from all directions. We will talk about all of them eventually, but first: the **Solar Probe Cup (SPC)**. It's located right on the edge of the heat shield and so it gets the most interesting results.

The SPC has two grids. The outer grid allows particles through to the inner grid, which allows particles with certain speeds. Successful particles deposit a charge against the metal behind the inner grid and are registered.  
  
Having this data enables us to determine the behavior of the alpha particles (radioactive particles stripped of their electrons)-- knowing this information will help us conduct spacetravel in the future.  
  
We'll save the more in-depth explanation of the Solar Probe Cup, as well as the Parker Space Probe's measures against heat, photoimaging technology and others in the follow-up article.  
  
Until next time!

[//]: # Now, you may be wondering: How does is all this sensitive equipment protected?
  
[//]: # There are two main parts to the PSP for protection against the intense temperatures of the Sun:  

[//]: # 1. Thermal Protection System (TPS)
[//]: # 2. Light sensor

[//]: # As you can see, the TPS is heavily reinforced to sustain extreme temperatures. It is eleven centimeters thick that sees 1300 degrees Celsius on the outward side, and 300 degrees on the bottom side. The long arm on the back (or ram) contains the light sensor that keeps the shield pointing at the optimal angle so as to not damage equipment.
