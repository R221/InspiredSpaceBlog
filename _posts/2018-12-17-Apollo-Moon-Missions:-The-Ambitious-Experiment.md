# President Kennedy: "Let's land on the moon!" NASA: "Hold my beer."

"We choose to go to the Moon." President John F. Kennedy's famous words on September 12, 1962 would trigger the most massive experiment in the history of mankind: land humans on the Moon. Now you may be thinking, "Isn't Mars a bigger deal?" Yes and no. While getting to Mars is like [launching a massive bear 300 million miles](https://inspiredspace.blog/Why-is-Landing-On-Mars-So-Difficult-Some-InSight.html) and is undoubtedly impressive, the systems and structures used largely build on the lessons learned from the Apollo missions.  

Even NBA star [Steph Curry](https://jezebel.com/steph-curry-is-not-a-moon-landing-conspiracy-theorist-1831097873) agrees about the significance of landing on the moon.     
  
In this article we consider a broad overview of the beginning of the program and why it was such a big deal. Details regarding each mission will be elaborated on in depth in future articles.
  
## The Beginning - Two Vital Missions

Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969 at the penultimate moment of Apollo 11; notably, less than seven years after Kennedy's speech. 

To be sure, we had no idea what we were doing. This was pinnacle of all challenges to date: rocket science had to be *invented*. And there was competition. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched satellite Sputnik. To make matters worse, 1961 saw the world's first human to orbit the Earth, [Yuri Gagarin](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/gagarin.html) (whose questionable nickname is "Columbus of the Cosmos").  
  
In the eyes of a nation always wanting to be first, America could simply not fall behind the Communist rival-- the space race was on.  
  
Like earning a bachelor's degree, this was going to take some time. And money. *Lots of money*. The cost of the entire Apollo mission was $25.4 billion in 1973 money ($144.3 billion in 2017 money). Considering, however, that this accounted for everything from development to landing on the Moon and more I think that's a pretty good deal.  
  
Especially to be first.  
  
## Apollo 1: The first and most important

*January 27, 1967*

In my view, the tragedy of Apollo 1 was the most important of all the Apollo missions because of the extremeness of its disastrous outcome. Three astronauts, Virgil Grissom, Edward White, and Roger Chaffee died as a result of a fire that swept through the command module. Monetary losses not withstanding, consider the psychological devastation here. We basically just crashed our new Razor scooter into the mud (along with all our stuff) right in front of the school bully. And our prized hamster that we spent years training and grooming was in the bag and, well... Ouch.   
  
The two biggest errors were having much of the material in the command module's cabin be flammable, and a pure-oxygen cabin. Perfect conditions for a fire, which is exactly what happened. A shorted circuit created a spark, which ignited the air inside the cabin. Within thirty seconds, the crew was dead. The astronauts tried to open the hatch, but the inward-opening design proved to be too difficult to operate from the inside.    
  
The point is, these were egregious errors that probably should not have happened in the first place. That's the thing with experiments-- even the brightest people make errors.  
  
And Apollo was a huge, ambitious experiment. 
  
## Apollo 1 Aftermath

Manned missions were understandably banned for 21 months. Over a year and half [investigation](https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/inv.html), many changes were made including the implementation of self-extinguishing materials; an outward-opening hatch; a nitrous-oxygen mix of air for ground tests; and others. We learned our lesson and moved forward.
  
While the day's losses are not to be understated, there was some good that came of it. Something powerful, in fact: fierce determination to get it right. Apollo 1 serves as a reminder even today that this stuff is real and it is dangerous. I'm not saying NASA "didn't care" at the beginning, they just didn't know what they were doing. How are you supposed to know what you don't know, you know? We would have to know for Apollo 4, however, as that was just around the corner.
  
## Apollo 4: A Welcomed (and Much Needed) Success

*November 9, 1967*

Apollo 4 was unmanned. But just because there were no humans on board did not mean the mission wasn't risky. Apollo 1 happened less than a year before this first launch of Saturn V. For most people, it was likely a distant memory that did not to be dwelled on. A small few were skeptical of the mission, but I'm willing to bet most of them were Russian. I think of this feeling as making a second attempt on something you failed at the first time and your parents warn you to not do it again, else fear the consequences. Except this time you succeed and your parents are no longer mad.    
  
The main goal of Apollo 4 involved:

> "testing of structural integrity, compatibility of launch vehicle and spacecraft, heat shield and thermal seal integrity, overall reentry operations, launch loads and dynamic characteristics, stage separation, launch vehicle subsystems, the emergency detection system, and mission support facilities and operations".  
  
Fortunately, everything went smoothly and the mission was deemed a huge success for NASA. It provided a wealth of information on stage separation and vehicle systems, which were an excellent start to the future development of what would be 13 launches on the Saturn V platform.  
  
## What do these missions mean for the future of Apollo?

So far, we have seen one disaster and one major success. Both were critical to the Apollo program as they provided ample opportunities for improvement and development. As we will see in the next article, despite these advances, mistakes were still made. But it's critical to note the complexity and scale of this mission; humankind was doing something that had *never been done before*. Not exactly an easy task.  
  
Holistically, the following missions provided a win not just for the US, but for humans. And for a universe that favors high [entropy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/energy-and-enzymes/the-laws-of-thermodynamics/v/introduction-to-entropy) (disorder), I would say that is rather excellent.
