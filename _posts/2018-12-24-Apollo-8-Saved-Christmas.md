Christmas in 1968 was stressful for the United States.  
  
Imagine college finals week, where the smallest annoyance is stressful. Your significant other recently decided to "part ways", so that's cool. You have a huge Physics exam the next day, which you really need to do well on. And that Kevin guy in the front brags to you that he's going to score the highest on the test and beat you in the course. Ultimate bragging rights.    
  
Game on,*Kevin*.  
  
This is what NASA was going through in 1968, well, sort of. For starters, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated. And then the violent Tet Offensive in Vietnam was launched. It's not like there was a shortage of stuff for America to worry about.    
  
So in the midst of all this, how does a space program just carry out a mission like *sending people to the Moon*? That seems like a real pushing-your-luck kind of move.  
  
Just like your encounter with Kevin: competition. [The CIA incorrectly informed NASA of a Soviet Union manned lunar mission.](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/nov/30/apollo-8-mission) At the time it was certainly believable. America simply could not lose once again in the space race to these Communist rivals.  
  
So, NASA took a chance and went for it. It paid off.

So despite launching a manned mission way before it was really ready, Apollo 8's success made it much easier to eventually land on the moon a total of six times. But it's not only about the past-- in the mission to get to Mars, establishing a longterm endeavor on the Moon is critical.  
  
Of course, establishing a human presence on the Moon is a big deal, but it's only one piece in our ever-evolving mission to explore and understand this vast universe in which we live.
