## Officially Cool: Seismometer Placed Onto Mars by NASA InSight is Hype

![NASA InSight places seismometer on Mars](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia22956-16.jpg)

Firstly, I apologize for saying "hype". Second, **this is so hype!**  
  
What looks like a [Dungeons and Dragons dice](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Yi8HRcDoL._SX425_.jpg), the seismometer placed by NASA's InSight Probe is the [first seismometer placed on another planet](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars), *ever!*  
  
The placing of the seismometer completes a major mission milestone, according to NASA. InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman is optimistic, stating that the "timetable of (mission) activites has gone better than we hoped". A wonderful Christmas present indeed, Tom!  
  
InSight landed on Mars on Nov. 26, and has already been sending some preliminary information back to Earth, but scientists say they will need about a year before enough data is in to produce results.  
  
### A delicate procedure

As you can imagine, placing a delicate science instrument is a task that requires accuracy and precision. That's why the main part in all of this, the probe's robotic arm, was tested thoroughly. JPL even made a [test bed replicating Martian conditions](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7309) to get a grasp of exactly what InSight sees.  
  
This allowed scientists to analyze all possible locations to place the seismometer. [As I guessed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/InspiredSpace_/status/1075561021648052225), the best location for the instrument was the farthest possible spot the lander's arm could reach, 5.367 feet away. NASA prompted readers to guess between several potential spots for the seismometer to be placed. So what did I do? I used my college-degree skills and guessed C, and as it turns out I was right. You hear that professor? It *does* work!   

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently it even works on another planet! ðŸ˜‚</p>&mdash; NASA InSight (@NASAInSight) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAInSight/status/1075788327553425409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2018</a></blockquote>

Now that I have officialy flexed my interaction with the coolest people in our universe, let the article continue.  
  
### Purpose

Seismometers (or seismographs) record details of earthquakes, such as intensity and duration. By deploying a seismometer on Mars, scientists will be able to study the depth and composition of the Martian interior by measuring "marsquakes", the new term for motion on the Martian surface.  
  
With each marsquake comes further understanding of the interior of the planet. It's like walking in a dark cave with a glow-stick that glows in an interval-- you only see when the stick glows, similiar to the seismometer receiving data when there is a marsquake.  
  
Not only that, but the seismometer accounts for about three-fourths of InSight's mission objectives. So clearly, this is a critical piece of the mission. The fact that it has been successfully placed is as important as the actual landing on Mars.

### Conclusion
  
This is truly the time to be alive for the coming of the Space Age-- we are living in an era of many firsts, which is truly exciting! Real progress is being made every day in discovering what the universe is made of and how we can get out there to explore it ourselves.  
  
I feel like I say this at the end of almost every article I write now, but I can't help it: We are a curious species, never satisfied with today's results. We push and push and push, there is no ending. We push because we must know. And we're not going to run out of mysteries any time soon.  
  
Leave a comment below about your thoughts on Mars? What will we find? I sure hope it's not spiders...
