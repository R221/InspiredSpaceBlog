## Briefly, what is a nebula?

A nebula is a rather thin group of clumpy clouds of hydrogen gas and dust in interstellar space (that is, space between stars). There are many different [kinds of nebulae](http://astroa.physics.metu.edu.tr/twn/types.html), each having its own defining characteristics.

## Lagoon Nebula facts

The [Lagoon Nebula](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/lagoon-nebula-visible-light-view), or M8, was discovered in 1747 by Legentil de La Galasisiere. This man's name alone has us off to a great start.  
  
Located 4,000 light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius, the Lagoon Nebula is classified as a "bright nebula". More precisely, an H II region emission nebula. All that really means is there is at least one central bright (and therefore extremely hot) star emitting lots of light. The Lagoon has two such stars, Sagittari and Herschel 36. I'll refer to Herschel 36 as H36 from now on, mostly because I'm still sad of the actor who played Herschel from the Walking Dead passing away.  
  
H36 is the brighter of the two by several magnitudes, or levels. It's also the star in the north-central area of the above picture. H36 is 32 times more massive than our Sun, and is a quite hot 40,000 degrees Kelvin (71,500 degrees Farenheit)-- 160 times hotter than the temperature for cooking chicken in the oven. Your normal thirty-five minutes cooking time just turned into 1/5 of one second (assuming the chicken would not simply be incinerated).

## The first image explained: UV rays and radiation

It's quite a colorful scene! And with such beauty comes destruction and violence. Stars emit light and heat producing energy in the core, which is why stars shine. The more massive the star, the more energy it puts out in the form of heat and light. These energy levels coincide with certain wavelengths of light. One ray is the ultraviolet (UV) ray, which produces radiation.  
  
**Radiation** occurs because UV rays actually have *too much* energy. So instead of just heating up an object, UV rays knock electrons away from atoms and thus change the chemical structure of living organisms' cells. We wear sunscreen to protect from the harmful effects of radiation.

Remember that nebulae are composed of much gas and dust. The radiation emitted by H36
