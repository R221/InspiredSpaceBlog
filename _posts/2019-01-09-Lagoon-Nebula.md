## What is a nebula?

A nebula is a thin group of clumpy clouds of hydrogen gas and dust in interstellar space (that is, space between stars). There are many different [kinds of nebulae](http://astroa.physics.metu.edu.tr/twn/types.html), each having its own defining characteristics.

## Lagoon Nebula facts

The [Lagoon Nebula](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/lagoon-nebula-visible-light-view), or M8, was discovered in 1654 by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna. This man's name alone has us off to a great start.  
  
Located in the constellation Sagittarius near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, the Lagoon Nebula is classified as a bright nebula. More precisely, an H II region emission nebula. That tells us there is at least one central bright (and therefore extremely hot) star emitting lots of light. The Lagoon has two such stars: Sagittari and Herschel 36. I'll refer to Herschel 36 as H36 from now on, mostly because I'm still sad about Herschel from The Walking Dead passing away.    
  
Anyway, H36 is the brighter of the two stars by several magnitudes (levels). It's also the star in the north-central area of the above picture. H36 is 32 times more massive than our Sun, and is a quite hot 40,000 degrees Kelvin (71,500 degrees Farenheit)-- 160 times hotter than the temperature for cooking chicken in the oven. Your normal thirty-five minutes cooking time just turned into 1/5 of one second (assuming the chicken would not simply be incinerated).

## The first image explained: UV rays and radiation

It's quite a colorful scene! And with such beauty comes destruction and violence. Stars emit light and heat producing energy in the core, which is why stars shine. The more massive the star, the more energy it puts out in the form of heat and light. These energy levels coincide with certain wavelengths of light. One ray is the ultraviolet (UV) ray, which produces radiation.  
  
**Radiation** occurs because UV rays actually have *too much* energy. So instead of just heating up an object, UV rays knock electrons away from atoms and thus change the chemical structure of living organisms' cells. We wear sunscreen to protect from the harmful effects of radiation.

Remember that nebulae are composed of much gas and dust. The radiation emitted by H36 is so intense that curtains of space dust are pushed away and the stat's light shines through, like the Sun bursting through thunderclouds and rainfall.

The above picture focuses on the brightest part of the Lagoon, **Hourglass**. H36 is the bright red circle. The blue areas are oxygen, green for hydrogren, and red for sulfur.   
  
See those tornado-looking funnels in the center? They are formed by a combination of difference in temperatures (hot on the surface and cool inside the cloud) and pressure from starlight, whose horizontal pressure shears into the cloud, causing it to twist.    
Each of these eerie funnels is about one-half lightyear long (~46 million miles).  
  
## Life lessons from Herschel 36

*What can a star teach us about life?*  
  
A lot, I think.  
  
My takeaway is that you can make a huge impact on your circumstances, no matter how big the stage. It just requires effort and a lot of proactive practice. H36 does this; granted, it *is* thirty-two times more massive than our Sun... but still, it's only one star in a nebula with a length 110 times that of Earth to the Sun.  
  
This can be analogous to many of us here on Earth; sometimes we feel that there is too much going on, or we just don't have the ability to make an impact. All it takes to make change, however, is persistent, magnitudinal effort. It may at first seem like you are throwing your life off-kilter, but change is never easy-- especially when you have big plans for your future.
