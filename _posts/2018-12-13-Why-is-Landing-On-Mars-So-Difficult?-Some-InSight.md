# Vaulting a bear over 300 million miles and landing as an Olympic gymnast is difficult

Since 1975, NASA has landed eight spacecrafts on Mars. The [InSight Lander](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/), landing on November 26, 2018, is the most recent in the #JourneytoMars. Its success is a crucial win for the [Mars Exploration Program](https://mars.nasa.gov/).  
  
How did NASA get the InSight Lander to Mars? They had to overcome two main obstacles: the distance and the landing.

## 1. Shipping a kodiak bear 300 million miles

While we have sent much larger spacecraft to Mars before (Curiosity Rover at 2,000 pounds), it is still a monumental effort to achieve this. At 800 pounds, InSight is about the size of a adult male kodiac bear, the grizzly's big brother.

Earth and Mars meet just close enough on their respective orbits around the Sun that we can take advantage of using less rocket fuel. We have to aim for where Mars is going to be instead of where it is when we launch, like a quarterback throwing a football. This is called a [Hohmann Transfer Orbit](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/chapter4-1/). The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has a one-minute video on this, [check it out!](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/video/mars-in-a-minute-how-do-you-get-to-mars/)

So, want to ship a bear from D.C. to San Francisco 107,000 times?

## 2. Land at a precise location on a difficult terrain- Perfectly
  
The spacecraft must now slow down and stick a perfect landing, like an olympic gymnast. This is the most difficult part of landing on Mars because it is the most sensitive. One mistake can ruin the entire mission. This entails slowing down from 13,000 miles per hour all the way to zero. Engineers have lovingly dubbed this stage the:  

## "7 Minutes of Terror": InSight's Nail-Biting Landing Process

There are only seven minutes between entering Mars's atmosphere and landing (due to its thin atmosphere). InSight's landing process started *two months* before then. According to NASA, this included:  

>"The final trajectory correction maneuvers, which are used to make final adjustments to the spacecraft's incoming trajectory at Mars; attitude pointing updates, as necessary, for communications and power; frequent "Delta DOR" measurements that monitor the spacecraft's position and ensure accurate delivery; start of the entry, descent, and landing software, which automatically executes commands during landing; entry, descent, and landing parameter updates; spacecraft activities leading up to the final turn to the entry attitude and separation from the cruise stage; the loading of surface sequences and communication windows needed for the first several Martian days".

Upon entry, a large parachute was deployed. Then 12 retro rockets fired for a gentle descent. Touchdown! You can watch NASA's archived video of the live landing [here](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22160/mission-control-live-nasa-insight-mars-landing/?site=insight).  
  
InSight is no ordinary mission. Honestly, none of them really are. While the process of sending people and objects into space is largely not new, it is far from a perfectly formulated routine. But every time we do it, we get better at it and, crucially, we learn so much more about what we are researching. It is crucial that we keep exploring the universe around us-- to unveil the universe's secrets, but also to potentially find a new home for the human race.
  
In fact, NASA already has planned the next Mars mission, [Mars 2020](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/)!
