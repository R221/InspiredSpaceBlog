Spacecraft [New Horizons](https//www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html) flew by Ultima Thule on January 1,2019 at 12:33AM Eastern Time. Yeah, New Years Day. Quite fortuitous timing considering the distance covered: over four billion miles.  
  
That's pretty far.  
  
One billion miles past Pluto in the Kupier Belt, Ultima Thule is a giant rock that was discovered in 2014 by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. Today, the New Horizons spacecraft flew by it, marking the furthest object mankind has ever observed. It's a pretty big deal and a critical moment in small bodies research.  
  
In fact, "NASA is investing over five billion dollars in small body research in this decade alone" NASA Associate Administrator Thomas Zurbuchen stated on [NASA TV's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg) Ultima Thule livestream on Dec 31.  
  
## Importance of Ultima Thule

Due to sheer distance, scientists had to wait six hours for the first data to come through. Over 20 months will be needed to receive all data (since the spacecraft is still moving away from us). Until then, we will see fragments of data- which is really cool as it is.  
  
Well, that's kind of it for now. This is a fairly short article at this point for two reasons: there is *so much* information... and also so little. All we can say right now is that this research is critical for helping us understand the history of the universe.  
  
In order to understand where Earth comes from, you have to understand the universe as a whole. These small bodies have been around for thousands of years- they have seen everything and remain largely unchanged. That's why they're so important.  
  
### Similar NASA missions in the coming years

New Horizons is the first major spacecraft to observe small bodies. The [Lucy](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/lucy-the-first-mission-to-jupiter-s-trojans) mission launches in 2021 to study Jupiter's Trojans, a large group of asteroids that share Jupiter's orbit around the Sun. Principal investigator Harold "Hal" Levison has stated that "Lucy will give us an opportunity to compare data from Ultima Thule and better understand the structure of bodies".  
  
Another cool mission is [Psyche](https://psyche.asu.edu/). Psyche is a small body the size of Massachusetts orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter that is extraordinarily unique: it has an exposed metal surface. In fact, researchers think Psyche is the leftover core of an early planet- making this the only core we can explore (typical cores are far too hot for instruments to reach).  
  
The mission, led by Lindy Elkins-Taton, is undoubtedly another fantastic opportunity to research the history of our solar system.
  
### NASA, You, and Me: All in this together

Zac Efron does have at least one thing right: life is a team sport, and spaceflight is no different. "Spaceflight is a team sport", says New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern. He couldn't be more right. Each team for each mission takes dozens of people and thousands of hours of work to succeed. Elkins-Taton mentioned that over 230 undergraduate students have participated so far in the Psyche mission just two years in.  
  
This progress is not just for scientists and universities, however. It has been stated many times that the public is going to be a large part of these future missions. NASA has a big goal to involve more people in the business of space exploration; this is smart, as sometimes it can definitely be difficult to get into topics like these. Indeed, how does one know about a giant metal asteroid in space unless actively studying the field of space?  
  
Suffice it to say, these missions are all critical for understanding just one part of the beautiful chaos our universe is. We are in the beginning of an incredible time, and I hope you will join me- and everyone else in the space community- along for the ride. There is nothing more satisfying than finding your place in such a massive, mysterious universe.
