*This is part one in a multi-part series. Stay tuned for more in-depth information.*  
  
[Dr. Eugene Parker](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/eugene-newman-parker) is an accomplished theoretical physict whose name you may not recognize. Heard of *solar wind*? Well, he's the guy who discovered it. And now his name christens the fastest ever manmade spacecraft: The **Parker Solar Probe (PSP)**.   

And it's heading right towards the Sun.  

## Dr. Eugene Parker: Ahead of his time

In 1958, Dr. Parker published [Dynamics of the Interplanetary Gas and Magnetic Fields](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1958ApJ...128..664P&data_type=PDF_HIGH&whole_paper=YES&type=PRINTER&filetype=.pdf), outlining his theory that solar wind emanates from celestial bodies. At first, nobody believed him. *Why would there be stuff between us and the Sun? It's just empty, duh!*  

But just four years later, spacecraft Mariner 2 proved Dr. Parker right by discovering the presence of this energy. Great! So now time to send a probe and examine it, right?  
  
The launch was anything but immediate. In fact, it just launched on August 12, 2018. Talk about delayed gratification. Why did it take so long? Most likely a combination of funding and plausibility. Think about it: would you drive an hour to the grocery store for an item every single person was telling you they didn't have? Certainly not. No one thought solar wind was worth the investigation, or that it even existed at all.  
  
Dr. Parker was ahead of his time like Leonardo da Vinci, who invented flying machines, parachutes, and tanks far before the world was ready for them.

## The importance of solar wind

[Solar wind](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml) is the energy given off by the Sun's upper atmosphere, the *corona*, that permeates the entire solar system. It's everywhere.  

It's important to study for several practical reasons:  
  
1. It is hugely impactful on Earth's immediate environment
2. To understand interplanetary travel conditions (because solar wind is everywhere)
3. To gain a better understanding of the Sun, thus gaining insight of the behavior of other stars

But perhaps the most interesting reason of all:  
  
*Controlled nuclear fusion*. When two particles are pushed together until the merge, thus producing incredible amounts of energy. Perfecting this process will present a highly efficient and cheap source of energy, in stark contrast to our current situation. Luckily, we're pretty close to it. The UK -- one day before this writing -- announced ["Fusion Island", where they hope to demonstrate controlled fusion by 2019](https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3067747/fusion-island-uk-start-up-reveals-plans-for-pioneering-nuclear-fusion-research).  

What a time to be alive.  
  
## Back on track: Parker Solar Probe instruments

The Parker Solar Probe measures quite a few variables using a group of highly-sensitive sensors known as *SWEAP*.  
  
- **S**olar  
- **W**ind  
- **E**lectrons  
- **A**lpha (particles)  
- **P**rotons  
  
Most of these sensors are located on the backside of the probe, therefore collecting information from all directions except the front. The **Solar Probe Cup (SPC)** is located right on the edge of the heat shield on the front side, obtaining the most interesting results (to me at least).
  
The SPC has two grids: The outer grid filters particles of certain speeds through to the inner grid, like some sort of extremely fine astrophysical colander. Successful particles deposit a charge against the metal behind the inner grid and are registered.  
  
This data enables us to determine the behavior of the alpha particles (radioactive particles stripped of their electrons), which will help us conduct spacetravel in the future.  
  
That's a good overview for now, so we'll save the more in-depth explanation of the Solar Probe Cup and other features of the probe's measures against heat, photoimaging technology and others in the follow-up article.  
  
Until next time!

[//]: # Now, you may be wondering: How does is all this sensitive equipment protected?
  
[//]: # There are two main parts to the PSP for protection against the intense temperatures of the Sun:  

[//]: # 1. Thermal Protection System (TPS)
[//]: # 2. Light sensor

[//]: # As you can see, the TPS is heavily reinforced to sustain extreme temperatures. It is eleven centimeters thick that sees 1300 degrees Celsius on the outward side, and 300 degrees on the bottom side. The long arm on the back (or ram) contains the light sensor that keeps the shield pointing at the optimal angle so as to not damage equipment.
