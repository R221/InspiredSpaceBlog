## Space Elevators are like the trains of space: fast, affordable, and highly scalable

Space elevators are the stuff of dreams for futurists and literally everyone wanting to get a glimpse of outer space someday (me!). These 60,000 mile-long towers would be anchored into the Earth and held erect by the tension of the Earth's rotation and a counterweight at one end of the structure, like spinning in a circle with your childhood friend. They would provide low-cost transportation of both people and objects such as satellites.  
  
The biggest issue with getting to space using rocket-based space launch is the physics of rocket propulsion. It takes so much constant force to break through our atmosphere that [over 90% of a rocket's weight is propellant.](https://isec.org/2016-05-29-06-04-13/what-is-a-space-elevator-in-500-words-or-less/) Imagine not having to use any propellant at all, just electricity like a normal elevator. Except, well, this one is powered by sunlight and *goes into space*.  
  
Today's rocket launches cost up to $400 million, about $10,000 per pound for low Earth orbit! The cost of traveling by space elevator pales by comparison, it would be like taking the subway/underground on a morning commute. Currently, commercial airliners charge about $1 per pound, and train transportation just cents per pound. The low cost of transportation, especially when it is powered by sunlight and laser light as a space elevator would be, screams affordable infrastructure and thus scalability. There is just one problem with building a space elevator.

The materials. (You thought I was going to say cost, didn't you?)

Surprsingly, cost is not an issue here. Despite being approximately $6 to $10 billion to build such an elevator, saving $400 million each trip would quickly pay for itself. The biggest hold up right now is the materials. This tower has to extend 60,000 miles away from Earth, but massing only about 100 tons. That means we need really strong and leightweight material:[carbon nanotubes](https://www.cheaptubes.com/carbon-nanotubes-properties-and-applications/). With a structure shaped like soccer balls, they are 100 times stronger than steel, as flexible as plastic, and leightweight. Indeed, this material is what [Lockheed Martin planned to use](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/09/06/will-lockheed-martin-build-a-space-elevator.aspx) to build their space elevator (which they secured a patent for in 2002). Until one major flaw was uncovered.  
  
Their size. A nanotube is microscopic. Lockheed itself is working to scale up this material so it can be used to build a space elevator. Unfortunately, making them bigger results in a decreased effectiveness of the material itself. Bummer. They did find something hopeful, though: carbon *macro*tubes. A bigger version of the nanotube that has a thin polymer layer with a tensile strength of around 130 GPa (giga pascals). Guess what the magic number of GPa is needed to build a space elevator? 130. So it is definitely possible! Which is enough to sway some companies and even governments to start experimenting with it.

### Progress: Materials and Cost

In fact, just this October, [Japan sent a miniature space elevator](https://www.space.com/41278-japan-space-elevator-cubesats-experiment.html) to the International Space Station. Named the STARS-Me (Space Tethered Autonomous Robotic Satellite-Mini Elevator), it connects two cube satellites, very small satellites, by a 33-foot steel cable/tehter. A small container uses its own motor to go from one satellite to the other. Very cool! The tests have yet to be completed, but they are supposed to be coming very soon.  
  
Still more radical, Tokyo-based Obayashi Corporation has [announced a fully functional space elevator by 2050](https://www.space.com/14656-japanese-space-elevator-2050-proposal.html)! I'm not sure how likely this is given the materials problem. Oh, and Obayashi estimates the cost around $90 billion.  
  
Despite these uncertainties, I have full faith that we will build a space elevator relatively soon. Can you imagine looking out the window at Earth, as astronauts do every day on the International Space Station? This would undoubtedly make space travel a real possibility for many people, and would capture the minds of pretty much everyone. These are the kinds of things that inspire us to push further than ever before. When that day comes, it will truly mark the beginning of the Space Age.  
  
What do you think about space elevators? Are they a reality, or just science fiction? Would you use one? Leave a comment below!
