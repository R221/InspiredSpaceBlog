# Voyager 2 may be far away from home, but it's still a ways from really being gone

I thought graduating college would mean an high-paying job in a nice place where I could start my own life. Then reality hit me like a ton of dark matter and I lived with my parents for a bit. Voyager 2, like a true college grad struggling to get on his feet, has made it quite far as the second manmande object to exit the Sun's protective bubble known as the heliosphere-- but we still can make contact and see where it's headed, just like our parents.  
  
The onboard Plasma Science Experiment (PLS) no longer detects [solar wind](https://inspiredspace.blog/Parker-Solar-Probe.html#some-background-what-the-heck-is-solar-wind-and-why-is-it-so-important), which is very telling of its position.

But no solar wind does not equal no solar system. Mild math incoming. 

The Oort Cloud, a spherical shell around our Sun and planets, is the next step. Just getting there will prove to be a challenge; at 1,000 AU (93 billion miles) away from Earth, it will take Voyager another 360 years to reach the *beginning* of it. Then, we have to travel approximately 150,000 (14 trillion miles) to get through it. That will take over 60,000 years. So even though it takes 16 hours to retrieve information traveling at light speed from Voyager 2, it basically lives in the next state over. Just like me. **Sigh* *

What happens after the Oort Cloud? Voyager will orbit around the Milky Way galaxy for millions of years. And who knows, maybe some aliens will find it and come take over our planet. But as far as the forseeable future is concerned, NASA will have to make tough decisions about what systems to cut to preserve resources for the scientifc instruments.  
  
While we may never get to see Voyagers 1 and 2 get to the Oort Cloud and subsequently out of our solar system, I take solace in knowing that every piece of data gathered from the two probes will help us go further than we have ever gone before. Maybe some day we will see enough advance in space travel to really go the distance.
