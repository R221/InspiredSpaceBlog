# NASA made a cubic Roomba that does more than just clean
  
Imagine if your Roomba could do more than just clean the kitchen floor-- what if it could also find and put away all your spoons; determine if the dog's barking is too loud (it is) and also set the table's forks using... *magnetism*?  
  
[Astrobee](https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee), the second-gen free-flying robot out of [NASA Game Changing Development Program](https://gameon.nasa.gov/) can do all of that and more (the first generation was [SPHERES](https://www.nasa.gov/spheres/home)). Astrobee is designed to make space life easier and more efficient for astronauts living on the International Space Station. NASA has just sent three of them on Expedition 58 on December 3, 2018.

It can do quite a few things. Aside from having six different cameras, an impeller (a rotating container that moves fluid to measure speed and distance), a touch screen, laser pointer and flashlights,  [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2154.html) says, 

> The robots are designed to help scientists and engineers develop and test technologies for use in microgravity to assist astronauts with routine chores, and give ground controllers additional eyes and ears on the space station. The autonomous robots, powered by fans and vision-based navigation, perform crew monitoring, sampling, logistics management, and accommodate up to three investigations.  
  
So yeah, it's essentially a compact, *quiet* TARS from Christopher Nolan's *Interstellar*.
  
## Experiments and Implications

We've all seen sci-fi movies where the poor engineer has to tell the slightly-too-intense protagonist how to operate something entirely out of his depth. Imagine how frustrating that would be as the engineer having to explain delicate processes in a precise, timely manner to someone who can "only" fly a spaceship.  
  
Now, the engineers can do the work themselves thanks to Astrobee's ability to be **controlled remotely from the ground**.
  
This will enable scientists and engineers to work together on conducting experiments that 1) cannot be done on Earth, and 2) would be far too expensive to conduct on a large scale in space. *Magnetic propulsion*, for example, can accelerate objects simply by taking advantage of their electrical currents and magnetic fields thanks to the electromagnetic field that is produced by electrically charged objects.  
  
A good use case of magnetic propulsion would be a keeping a large group of satellites in formation in space to form a massive space telescope to see farther into the universe. The Astrobee will conduct such experiments on a much smaller scale, saving much time and money in the long run.

>Astrobeeâ€™s fan-based propulsion system frees it from needing any consumables except for battery charge; it is able to replenish its charge by autonomously connecting to its docking station
  
Scientific possibilities aside, think about the implications of this technology for those that operate this equipment remotely. *Anyone* can do work in space. No longer is this experience exclusive to only the most healthy or "perfect" individuals. A man who broke his leg in a car accident may not be able to physically visit space, but this is pretty close.

This is reminiscent of the first drone pilots. Before drones became a commercial and industrial phenomenon, flying was reserved for Pilots and Pilots Only. Now, everyone from military servicemembers to a third grader can fly. This is what advancement looks like. It's projects like this that instill hope. Not just in our ability to test zero-gravity, but hope that humanity can yet achieve great things given the drive and means to do so, even in circumstances unfriendly to the space agency and science in general. That is empowering not only for ourselves, but for our future generations to come.  
  
That may come off as melodramatic, but hope is in fact what keeps humans going. If there were no hope-- in discovering the secrets of the universe, of exploring new worlds, of being bold in the face of decades-old challenges-- there would be nothing but stagnation.   
  
And if I know one thing about humans, it is that we cannot stand still. We must advance, we must evolve. We must explore.
