Hi, my name is Robert!

> â€œIt is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring."  - Carl Sagan

Space, an unfailingly fascinating topic. I love reading anything and everything that goes on in space-- the problem is, the stuff can be quite thick. Technical jargon and concepts that require some formal physics and/or math to be understood are prevalent in the field. That's why I started InspiredSpace.blog! After I research a topic, I want to be able to spread what I have learned to others so you can learn, too! My friend, Karim, has the formal science training. I have the creative side and the desire to learn more. 


I'm always open for suggestions on new topics, articles, and other ways to improve the site. In addition to leaving a comment on my articles, please shoot me a message at contact@inspiredspace.blog for anything and everything you have to say! I hope my work is as fun to read as it is to write; it sometimes feels like I am perpetually preparing for a standup routine with some of this stuff.  
  
Sincerely,  
Robert James
