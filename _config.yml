    Robert James (yes, two first names) has a degree in B.S in Marketing. He enjoys nature, reading about science topics, and talking in the third person.  
      
    He started Inspired Space to provide easy perspectives on space that even he can understand and strengthen his writing skills. Robert wants to be involved with future NASA missions like Psyche and Lucy. (If you are involved with those and reading this, please contact me... err, him!)
